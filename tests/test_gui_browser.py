"""The editor rendered by a real browser, asserted to raise no JavaScript.

Every other GUI test drives the server or the state machine and renders nothing, so a
TypeError in ``app.js``'s render path passes the whole suite and breaks the editor the moment
it is opened. This boots the real app under uvicorn, loads it in headless chromium, and fails
on any console error or uncaught exception.

Skipped when playwright (or its browser download) is absent, so it costs nothing in an
environment that cannot run it -- but where it CAN run, it is the only check that would catch
a render-path throw before the operator does.
